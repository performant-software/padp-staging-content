      The Pan-African Data Project emerged from an earlier project, The Power
      Players of Pan-Africanism, a collaboration between Roopika Risam, who was
      then an associate professor at Salem State University, and Jennifer
      Powers, an MEd candidate in English education. Powers was also
      participating in the Digital Scholars Program, an opportunity to pursue
      digital humanities research that Risam founded along with Salem State’s
      archivist Susan Edwards and digital initiatives librarian Justin Snow.


      Risam was broadly interested in developing digital humanities research
      tools to support students and researchers in Black diaspora studies, while
      Powers was invested in the pedagogical possibilities of data literacy,
      particularly for introducing high school students to topics and people
      underrepresented in K-12 curricula. Together, Risam and Powers hatched a
      plan for research, data collection and curation, and data modeling: create
      a data set that identified events — conferences, meetings, symposia — from
      the Pan-Africanist Movement and the people who took part in them. During
      the Spring 2020, they were joined by Hibba Nassereddine, also an MEd
      candidate in English Education and Digital Scholars Program participant.

  - description: "Over the year, Risam, Powers, and Nassereddine undertook primary and secondary source research to find events and attendees, encountering the many problems inherent in working with data related to an understudied [something] [a project like this, give examples].. [also exploratory data viz] [coordinated work with Google Sheets and prototypes with Tableau & gephi.\_\n\nThe result of their work were datasets for 19 events committed to GitHub and a co-authored article, “Data Fail: Teaching Data Literacy with Digital Humanities.” in the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, voted 2nd runner up in the Digital Humanities 2020 awards. In addition to credit for their work on the project and the article, Powers and Nassereddine received graduate credit for independent studies, paid for by the districts where they were simultaneously student teaching.\_"
